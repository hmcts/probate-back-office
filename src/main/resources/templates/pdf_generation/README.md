# PDF Templating

This directory is configured in probate-commons as the root of the
template lookup handling - everything should be relative from here.
The initial implementation is just migrating the existing template
files as original.html.peb with a potential view to moving towards
more modular templates in the future to allow reuse of styles and
and macros.
