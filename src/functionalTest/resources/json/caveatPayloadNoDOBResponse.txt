For example, you may have good reason to believe that the will is not valid.If there is no will and you are entitled to inherit, you may believe you have a prior right to apply for the grant.You’ll need to complete an ‘appearance form’. If the appearance is accepted by the probate registry then the caveat will become permanent. This means that legal proceedings will be needed to resolve things.There is no fee for entering an appearance.The form needs to be sent to: Leeds District Probate Registry, York House, York Place, Leeds LS1 2BAIssue a ‘summons’You could issue a ‘summons’ if you believe you are equally entitled to apply for the grant as the person whose application you have stopped. This may be because you want to apply yourself, or believe there are good reasons the grant should not be issued to the person applying.You’ll need to complete a summons form and a sworn statement of facts setting out your reasons. If the summons is accepted by the probate registry, the registrar may give directions to you and the person whose application you have stopped.There is no fee for issuing a summons.The form needs to be sent to: Leeds District Probate Registry, York House, York Place, Leeds LS1 2BAHowever, there is a chance that a hearing may be needed.Whichever option you take, you may have to pay legal costs if you stop an application without a good reason.If you do nothing, the person who gave you the warning can apply to have your caveat removed after 14 days.You can get both appearance and summons forms from any probate registry, but probate staff cannot help you complete them or give you legal advice.Further information can be obtained via: https://www.gov.uk/wills-probate-inheritance/stopping-a-grant-of-representation#If you need to contact us Email Leeds District Probate Registry: Leedsdprenquiries@justice.gov.uk.RegardsThe Probate Registry
