[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hmcts/spring-boot-template.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hmcts/spring-boot-template)

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/hmcts/probate-back-office/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/hmcts/probate-back-office)

## Purpose

The purpose of this template is to speed up the creation of new Spring applications within HMCTS
and help keep the same standards across multiple teams. If you need to create a new app, you can
simply use this one as a starting point and build on top of it.

## What's inside

The template is a working application with a minimal setup. It contains:
 * application skeleton
 * common plugins and libraries
 * docker setup
 * code quality tools already set up
 * integration with Travis CI
 * Hystrix circuit breaker enabled
 * Hystrix dashboard
 * MIT license and contribution information

The application exposes health endpoint (http://localhost:4550/health) and metrics endpoint
(http://localhost:4550/metrics).

## Plugins

The template contains the following plugins:

  * checkstyle

    https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/checkstyle_plugin.html

    Performs quality checks on Java source files using Checkstyle and generates reports from these checks.
    The checks are included in gradle's *check* task (you can run them by executing `gradle check` command).

  * jacoco

    https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/jacoco_plugin.html

    Provides code coverage metrics for Java code via integration with JaCoCo.
    You can create the report by running the following command:

    ```bash
      ./gradlew jacocoTestReport
    ```

    The report will be created in build/reports subdirectory in your project directory.

  * io.spring.dependency-management

    https://github.com/spring-gradle-plugins/dependency-management-plugin

    Provides Maven-like dependency management. Allows you to declare dependency management
    using `dependency 'groupId:artifactId:version'`
    or `dependency group:'group', name:'name', version:version'`.

  * org.springframework.boot

    http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/

    Reduces the amount of work needed to create a Spring application

  * org.owasp.dependencycheck

    https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/dependency-check-gradle/index.html

    Provides monitoring of the project's dependent libraries and creating a report
    of known vulnerable components that are included in the build. To run it
    execute `gradle dependencyCheck` command.

  * com.github.ben-manes.versions

    https://github.com/ben-manes/gradle-versions-plugin

    Provides a task to determine which dependencies have updates. Usage:

    ```bash
      ./gradlew dependencyUpdates -Drevision=release
    ```

## Building and deploying the application

### Building the application

The project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org) as a build tool. It already contains
`./gradlew` wrapper script, so there's no need to install gradle.

To build the project execute the following command:

```bash
  ./gradlew build
```

## Docker environment

Because the probate back office relies on CCD callbacks it must be run inside the docker-compose environment, and must be built before bringing the environment up. You will need to recompile after any code changes.

Build the jar with:

```
./gradlew assemble
docker-compose build
```

Bring up the environment: 

```

# build the jar
./gradlew assemble

# before you start ensure that any env vars setup on whatever terminal you are --creat-ing from
XUI_LD_ID
LD_SDK_BO_KEY
LD_BO_USER_KEY
LD_SDK_FE_KEY
LD_FE_USER_KEY

# first time only
npx @hmcts/probate-dev-env --create

# spin up the docker containers
npx @hmcts/probate-dev-env

# Then wait at least 5 mins for the images to spin up - check the SIDAM and CCD and probate-backoffice ones have started fully
# To enable PBA payments for solicitors run this after startup of everything
```
docker-compose up -d wiremock
./bin/wiremock.sh
```

# to use local probate backoffice
docker-compose stop probate-back-office
./gradlew assemble
docker-compose up -d --build probate-back-office

# to clear out all images
npx @hmcts/probate-dev-env --destroy
docker container rm $(docker container ls -a -q)
docker image rm $(docker image ls -a -q)
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)

```

If you would like to test a new CCD config locally, you should run:

```
./ccdImports/conversionScripts/createAllXLS.sh probate-back-office:4104
./ccdImports/conversionScripts/importAllXLS.sh
```

## Full setup

Guidance on how to set up probate locally using the updated docker images.

##### 1) Install https://stedolan.github.io/jq/ 

```bash
  sudo apt-get install jq
```

For mac 
```bash
  brew install jq
```

NB. If you download the binary version it is called 'jq-osx-amd64' and the scripts later will fail because they are looking for 'jq'. 

##### 2) Login to azure

```bash
  az login
  az acr login --name hmctspublic --subscription DCD-CNP-Prod
  az acr login --name hmctsprivate --subscription DCD-CNP-Prod
```

##### 3) Reset your docker images, containers etc. 

```bash
   docker container rm $(docker container ls -a -q)
   docker image rm $(docker image ls -a -q)
   docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)
```

NB. Docker for desktop on a mac only allocates 2GB of memory by default, this is not enough I increased mine 16GB.

##### 4) Run environments script
```bash
   ./ccd login
```

For linux/Mac
```bash
   source ./bin/linux-set-environment-variables.sh
```
##### 4.1) setup logstash
 
In order to work locally on probate-frontend you will need to clone project ccd-logstash from github.
Checkout the probate-conf branch and build the docker image

```
   git checkout probate-conf
   docker build . -t ccd-logstash:probate
```   
 In probate-back-office/compose/elasticsearch.yml replace
   image: hmcts/ccd-logstash:latest with image: "ccd-logstash:probate"
   
##### 5) Start up docker 
```bash
   docker network create compose_default
   ./ccd compose pull
   ./ccd compose build
   ./ccd compose up
```

##### 6) Create blob store container
Once docker has started run
```bash
   ./bin/document-management-store-create-blob-store-container.sh
```

##### 7) Restart dm-store container
Find id of dm-store container
```bash
   docker ps | grep dm-store_1
```
Use id to stop container
```bash
   docker stop compose_dm-store_1_id
```

Start the dm-store container
```bash
   ./ccd compose up -d dm-store
```

#### 7.1) Restart other containers
On linux you may have to restart any failing containers. These often fail to start: 
* dm-store
* fees-api
* payments-api
* sidam-api

Restart in that order

##### 8) Setup IDAM data.
```bash
   ./bin/idam-client-setup.sh
```

To check the IDAM data, you can log into IDAM-web `http://localhost:8082/login` with `idamOwner@hmcts.net/Ref0rmIsFun`.

##### 9) Generate roles, json->xls and import

###### Create roles and users
```bash
   ./bin/ccd-add-all-roles.sh
```
You can check the user and roles on the IDAM-web by searching for `ProbateSolCW1@gmail.com` on Manager Users page.

###### Generate xls 
For mac
```bash
   ./ccdImports/conversionScripts/createAllXLS.sh docker.for.mac.localhost:4104
```
For Windows 10
```bash
   ./ccdImports/conversionScripts/createAllXLS.sh host.docker.internal:4104
```

For linux (replace ip with your own ip)
```bash
   ./ccdImports/conversionScripts/createAllXLS.sh probate-back-office:4104 
```

###### Import xls
```bash
   ./ccdImports/conversionScripts/importAllXLS.sh
```
 
 
##### 10) Start your local service 
###### Pull probate specific ccd-logstash
pull ccd-logstash branch probate-conf locally then

docker build . -t ccd-logstash:probate

###### Probate-back-office
Login to ccd on `http://localhost:3451`. Caseworker: `ProbateSolCW1@gmail.com / Pa55word11`. Solicitor  `ProbateSolicitor1@gmail.com / Pa55word11`.

Start logstash-probateman (for legacy cases)
```bash
   sudo /usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash -f logstash/legacy-case-data-local.conf
```

Run probate-back-office app. 

##### loging into to ccd-ui
For a solicitor use ProbateSolicitor1@gmail.com : password  
Alternatively, for a caseworker use  
ProbateSolCW1@gmail.com : password

##### local document-store 
You can go to a doc in dm by going to `localhost:3453/documents/[**ID**]/binary `.

###### Using Payments and fees
Add keywords to fees database
```bash
    ./bin/fees-add-keyword.sh
```
## Running Back Office Puppeteer End To End Tests
The tests are located at src/test/end-to-end and must be maintainend and run, as they are run as part of the nightly Jenkins CI build.
Configuration is set by default to be able to run in an npx created local environment without amendment. 

Config is by environment variables with defaults if not present. The .env file does not contain environment variables, 
and so default values will be used for local run. These can be found in src/test/config.js, and are used by
codecept config file src/test/end-to-end/codecept.conf.js.

The tests are node.js and best run in vs code. A launch vs code configuration has been provided to run the 
yarn script test:fullfunctional (not to be confused with functional tests).

To see if it's running ok, change config value TestShowBrowserWindow in config.js from false to true and the browser will 
show, allowing you to see what's going on.  
 
The default test configuration runs all end to end tests, however, often we just want to run the ones that are failing.
As a step towards running an individual test, a new env var has been added for local use: process.env.E2E_TEST_PATH
(see config.js).

This defaults to './paths/**/*.js', which the Jenkins nightly build will use. 
However you can set this to a specific .js file path in src/test/paths to narrow down to a failing area.

 
## Complete setup for local FE + e2e development
### probate-frontend
set following in default.yml
```
  useIDAM: 'true'
  requireCcdCaseId: 'true'
```
you shoud then be able to use a citizen user of
```
testusername@test.com/Pa55word11
```
add a dev.yaml file to the /config folder with contents
```
featureToggles:
  launchDarklyKey: 'sdk-4d50eb6e-8400-4aa7-b4c5-8bdfc8b1d844'
```
emails can be monitored at:
```
http://localhost:8025
```
run FE using 
```
yarn start:ld
```
You should also be able to debug on intellij by starting server.js

### probate-caveats-frontend
##### no changes

### probate-orchestrator
##### no changes

### probate-business-service
set the following application.yml
```
  port: 8081
```
set the following application.yml
```
document_management:
  url: http://localhost:5006
```

### probate-submit-service
##### no changes

### probate-backoffice
You will need to run with payments and fees docker images if you are expecting to make non-zero payments


## Running the application as a docker image

Create the image of the application by executing the following command:

```bash
  ./gradlew installDist
```

Create docker image:

```bash
  docker-compose build
```

Run the distribution (created in `build/install/spring-boot-template` directory)
by executing the following command:

```bash
  docker-compose up
```

This will start the API container exposing the application's port
(set to `4550` in this template app).

In order to test if the application is up, you can call its health endpoint:

```bash
  curl http://localhost:4550/health
```

You should get a response similar to this:

```
  {"status":"UP","diskSpace":{"status":"UP","total":249644974080,"free":137188298752,"threshold":10485760}}
```

When the containers are restarted, ccd data has to be reloaded
The user token expires approx every 4 hours

### Mac users
You will need to reconfigure your docker settings to allow at least 6.5Gb

## Hystrix

[Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki) is a library that helps you control the interactions
between your application and other services by adding latency tolerance and fault tolerance logic. It does this
by isolating points of access between the services, stopping cascading failures across them,
and providing fallback options. We recommend you to use Hystrix in your application if it calls any services.

### Hystrix circuit breaker

This template API has [Hystrix Circuit Breaker](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/How-it-Works#circuit-breaker)
already enabled. It monitors and manages all the`@HystrixCommand` or `HystrixObservableCommand` annotated methods
inside `@Component` or `@Service` annotated classes.

### Hystrix dashboard

When this API is running, you can monitor Hystrix metrics in real time using
[Hystrix Dashboard](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/Dashboard).
In order to do this, visit `http://localhost:4550/hystrix` and provide `http://localhost:4550/hystrix.stream`
as the Hystrix event stream URL. Keep in mind that you'll only see data once some
of your Hystrix commands have been executed. Otherwise `Loading ...` message will be displayed
on the monitoring page.

### Other

Hystrix offers much more than Circuit Breaker pattern implementation or command monitoring.
Here are some other functionalities it provides:
 * [Separate, per-dependency thread pools](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/How-it-Works#isolation)
 * [Semaphores](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/How-it-Works#semaphores), which you can use to limit
 the number of concurrent calls to any given dependency
 * [Request caching](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/How-it-Works#request-caching), allowing
 different code paths to execute Hystrix Commands without worrying about duplicating work
